### About

I’m a software engineer primarily focused on frontend development.

I care about:
- building maintainable systems
- writing clear and understandable code
- improving development efficiency through better tooling and workflows

Most of my work involves real-world products rather than demos or experiments.

---

### What I’m Working On

- Frontend development for complex applications
- Small tools and side projects that improve everyday workflows
- Exploring how AI can be used responsibly in software development

---

### Notes

- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Long-term maintainability matters more than short-term speed
- Good tools should stay out of the way
